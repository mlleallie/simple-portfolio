  <h3 class="unimportant">Value Proposition</h3>
    <p class="blahblah">
      There are a lot of web developers out there. Shit, throw a rock and you'll find some 12 year old skipping class who could build you a website. But I promise you that the 12 year old you hit with a rock will an unprofessional child who has absolutely no sense of style or efficiency. <br>

      <br>That's where I come in. Introducing: me. Allie Sudholt. Webdev, badass, coder extrodinare, the answer to all the problems you didn't know you had (but certainly have).
